Efforts put in: OpenMP > CUDA >>>>> MPI

Quite fun coding these, the MPI crashed in prof's tests but didn't get to see the test so NO IDEA WHAT WENT WRONG

The theme is simplified particle simulation - each particle is involved in at most 1 collision per time step.

I and my partner made a big fuss about particles overlapping :>

Also, my first ever C++ programs so teehee.
